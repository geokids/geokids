<h2>Reggio Principles</h2>
The educators and philosophical pedagogy of Reggio Emilia has inspired the GeoKids community for the past decade.<br><br>

The Reggio approach is a renowned educational philosophy based on children's learning through exploration of various mediums such as clay, paint, digital cameras, and musical instruments. Play allows young children to construct their early knowledge and develop the critical thinking skills that enable them to become independent, socially responsible and intellectually competent individuals.  The curriculum is emergent and derives from the interests of children, teachers facilitate children's learning, encouraging them to take an active part in constructing their ideas and knowledge.<br><br>
The philosophical elements of the Reggio approach that help guide GeoKids are the following:<br><br>

<strong>The Image of the Child</strong> - Adults see children as competent, full of potential and active in constructing his or her own knowledge through interactions with others. Adults try to understand as fully as possible the child's viewpoint and abilities (the child's "culture")<br><br>

<strong>Symbolic Representation</strong> - The Reggio Emilia approach can be seen as an extension of the "whole Language" approach as well as an entire array of creative media that are considered as "other languages". It is a way of using children's many ways of expressing themselves to enhance their creative, social and cognitive development.<br><br>

<strong>The Role of the Environment</strong> - Through conscious use of space, color, natural light, displays of children's work, and attention to nature and detail, the environment serves as another teacher. The environment serves as an initiation to enter and participate.<br><br>

<strong>Education Based on Interaction and Collaboration</strong> - A continuous interaction takes place with exchanges that go from teacher to children, children to children, teacher to teacher, teacher to parent and parent to teacher, and again from children to teacher in a circular process.<br><br>

<strong>The Role of the Teacher</strong> - Teacher facilitate children's ability to represent what they know and imagine. Teachers mediate between children's current understanding and what they are on the threshold of understanding by: reviewing and helping children tell the story of their own learning; arranging new experiences, challenges and problems; connecting children with resources; facilitating group discussions and social interactions; reflecting children's ideas; and facilitating the development of new skills.<br><br>

<strong>The Importance of Time</strong> - Projects and themes follow the children's interest and development of concepts. Projects and activities are not "one-shot deals", rather they build upon one another over time, as the experiences, activities and forms of expression.<br><br>

<strong>The Role of the Parents</strong> - The education process involves three equally important participants: children, teachers and parents, Parents have the right - and should be encouraged - to be active contributors in their children's activities, classrooms, school and development. The schools welcome parent involvement in a wide range of ways. Parents participating by giving time and talents and serve as an advocate for the schools in community politics.<br><br>
