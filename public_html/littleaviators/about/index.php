<strong>Curriculum</strong><br>
We draw our inspiration from a variety of sources including the schools of Reggio Emilia in northern Italy as well as Lillian Katz, George Forman, John Dewey and many others. We find some of the principles of the education project in the Reggio Schools to be especially persuasive. We base our work with children in the firm belief that children are competent and capable, constantly seeking opportunities to manifest their competence. We see children and teachers as co-learners, partnering to enhance the learning process through reciprocal interactions and exploration.<br><br>

It is our belief that good curriculum is child-centric and play based. It engages children in long-term projects where real investigations are pursued. Children's interests often lead to in-depth explorations that can last a few days or many months. Curriculum grows out of our understanding that young children learn best and thrive when their natural disposition toward curiosity is engaged and their investigations are hands-on. Children are most curious about the real world around them. They are natural researchers. As such, they respond to curriculum that emerges out of their own experiences and is enhanced by provocations and resources provided by the teachers, families, and the children themselves. You may very well see seasonal natural materials such as pumpkins and gourds of all sizes and shapes appearing in the classroom for purposes of exploration, experimentation and even cooking. Teachers become ardent researchers in partnership with the children. The role of the teacher as facilitator, listener, partner, advocate, provocateur, historian, risk-taker is vital to the learning outcomes of the children. Perceptive teachers pick up on these interests and through keen observation, find ways to enhance and deepen the explorations that engage the children. Perceptive teachers also know the value of a rich environment where words, books, music, art, and interactions abound, all resources at a child's fingertips.<br><br>

<strong>Guiding Principles</strong>
<br>
Little Aviators guiding principles are greatly influenced by the Reggio philosophy. Several key principles include:<br><br>

<tr><td width=20><td>
<strong>Children</strong>
<br>
All children have preparedness, potential, curiosity, and interest in constructing their learning, in engaging in social interaction and in negotiating with everything that their environment brings to them.<br><br>

<strong>Parents</strong>
<br>
Parenting is likely the most important vocation. Little Aviators believes that confident parents trust in their abilities to know what is best for their children. We prefer that parents be judged not by their mistakes but by their successes. Little Aviators parents partner with their children's caregivers to foster respectful and supportive relationships in their children's lives.<br><br>

<strong>Teachers</strong>
<br>
Providing care for children in a group setting is a challenging profession that requires significant training and dedication. At Little Aviators, teachers have the space and time they need to be reflective about their own processes, the security to take risks in developing their curricula, and the flexibility to address all of a child's needs: emotionally, academically, and otherwise. Parents often benefit from the language, educational tools and various styles Little Aviators' teachers employ. Our children develop close bonds with their teachers that ensure long after the day or the school year ends. Teachers have the full support of parents, staff and administration.<br><br>

<strong>Community</strong>
<br>
The children, parents and caregivers who make up the Little Aviators community recognize their broader community of friends and neighbors and the potential for collaboration. Little Aviators is an active participant in the community for education in the processes of parenting and childhood learning. We welcome opportunities to partner with members of our community to advance early childhood education.<br><br>
