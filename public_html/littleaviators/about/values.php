<h2>Little Aviators Values</h2>

<p>Little Aviators believes that children, families, teachers and the community at large can work together as resources to develop curriculum. It is the belief at Little Aviators that we are not preparing children specifically for kindergarten, but to have a life long love of learning. We offer a curriculum that challenges, encourages, and supports children in their quest for knowledge, recognizing the developmental stages of childhood and the unique gifts, talents and abilities of each child.</p>

<p>Little Aviators is inspired by the Reggio Emilia approach, which encourages children's intellectual development through systematic focus on symbolic representation, as children are encouraged to explore their environment and express themselves through words, movement, drawing, painting, playing, and other natural modes of expression.</p>

<p>Through daily observations, the teaching staff can pay close attention to recurring themes in the children's play, developmental issues, testing of hypotheses and theories, which is the foundation of the Emergent Curriculum practiced at Little Aviators.</p>

<p>It is the belief at Little Aviators that strong, rich, and meaningful curriculum is developed as relationships are developed. At Little Aviators, we value the following relationships:
<ul>
<li>Child to child,</li>
<li>Child to parent,</li>
<li>Child to caregiver,</li>
<li>Child to materials and environment,</li>
<li>Caregiver to parent, and</li>
<li>Caregiver to caregiver.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>We also believe that these relationships are not linear, but are spiral.  Supporting, caring and nurturing these relationships allows the children to negotiate the curriculum to fit their individual developmental and cognitive needs and interests.</p>

<i><strong>The Hundred Languages</strong><br>
No way. The hundred is there.<br><br>

The child<br>
is made of one hundred.<br>
The child has<br>
a hundred languages<br>
a hundred hands<br>
a hundred thoughts<br>
a hundred ways of thinking<br>
of playing, of speaking.<br><br>

A hundred always a hundred<br>
ways of listening<br>
of marveling, of loving<br>
a hundred joys<br>
for singing and understanding<br>
a hundred worlds<br>
to discover<br>
a hundred worlds<br>
to invent<br>
a hundred worlds<br>
to dream.<br><br>

The child has<br>
a hundred languages<br>
(and a hundred hundred hundred more)<br>
but they steal ninety-nine.<br>
The school and the culture<br>
separate the head from the body.<br>
They tell the child:<br>
to think without hands<br>
to do without head<br>
to listen and not to speak<br>
to understand without joy<br>
to love and to marvel<br>
only at Easter and at Christmas.<br><br>

They tell the child:<br>
to discover the world already there<br>
and of the hundred<br>
they steal ninety-nine.<br><br>

They tell the child:<br>
that work and play<br>
reality and fantasy<br>
science and imagination<br>
sky and earth<br>
reason and dream<br>
are things<br>
that do not belong together.<br><br>

And thus they tell the child<br>
that the hundred is not there.<br>
The child says:<br>
No way. The hundred is there.<br><br></i>

Founder of the Reggio Emilia Approach
