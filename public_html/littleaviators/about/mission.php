<strong>GeoKids and Little Aviators Connection</strong>
<br>
GeoKids is a non-profit organization incorporated for public benefit, with a chartered purpose to provide affordable quality childcare to the community. Our first priority is children, whom we want to be well cared for, stimulated, and encouraged to discover the world around them.<br><br>

Toward the broader fulfillment of GeoKids chartered purpose, in the spring of 2010 the GeoKids Board of Directors approved operating a second GSA-sponsored childcare program. Little Aviators, is located at the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) site in Southern California.<br><br><br>

<strong>Little Aviators Vision and Mission</strong>

Little Aviators is a close and unique community of children, parents and staff. Our first priority is our children, whom we want to be well cared for, stimulated and encouraged to discover the world around them. We also strive to meet the needs of our parents, staff and the greater community. Our vision is that everyone who comes in contact with Little Aviators share a common understanding of the program and have respect and appreciation for the program.Â
