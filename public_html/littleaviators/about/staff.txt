I started working at GeoKids in April of 2006. I've always loved working with children it's amazing to see how fast they can grow and develop in such a short amount of time. It's wonderful to be apart and witness the amazing things they learn everyday!<br><br>

When I am not working, I am a part time student. I love spending time with my family and friends. I also love to travel and play sports.

<strong>Sandy Liou</strong><br>
<br>

I have been part of the Geokids community since 2006.  The best part about my work is of course being with the children who never cease to impress me with how capable they are and inspire me with their love and curiosity for learning and life.  It has also been very rewarding and wonderful working with co-teachers, staff, and families who view and treat children as capable individuals in their own rights.  My interests outside of work include running, hiking, travelling, and reading.

I have worked with young children and families for many years both in the United Kingdom and here in California , I joined Geokids in 2007.

I started working seven years ago but I’ve been working in the classroom since I was 14 years old and have been teaching since that time. My affection for GeoKids is so strong that I cannot imagine teaching anywhere else. Preschool is my passion and I’m always amazed at what preschools can already do and how they view life.<br><br>
My hobbies include outdoor adventure travel, working on my home, spending time with my partner, family and friends.

I began my career with GeoKids in early 1999 and have been working in the field since 1990.<br><br>
What I enjoy most about working with children is being silly with them and watching them discover the "wows" and "whys" around them.<br><br>
While not at GeoKids, I am busy taking care of my own young children: singing songs and reading stories with them or looking for trucks in the neighborhood. I also enjoy gardening.
