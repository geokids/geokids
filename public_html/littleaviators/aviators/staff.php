<strong>Little Aviators Staff</strong><br>
The staff is chosen for their warmth, compassion, and their knowledge of child development in addition to their ability to support families. Respect is the underlying element in the philosophy of GeoKids. Respect is not limited to the children who are served by the program but is also extended to the families, staff and cultures included in the program.<br><br>

<strong>Jenny Taylor, Director</strong><br>
Jenny has been working with children, parents, and teachers since 1996. Teaching has always been her passion. She obtained her B.A. in Liberal Studies with an emphasis in Special Education from Cal State Dominguez Hills, her Teaching Certification from UCLA, and her Infant & Toddler Director's Credential from the University of Wyoming. Jenny was awarded The Cambridge Who's Who of Executives and Professionals 2007/2008 for her work in implementing the Reggio Emilia philosophy at a preschool nestled in the Tetons just outside of Jackson Hole, Wyoming, where she created a science-based curriculum for more than 100 children a day. She was a site supervisor for Leway Sailing Center, where children learned to swim, sail, canoe, and kayak. Her love of teaching has taken her on many travels - in Egypt, Jenny was an international nanny, and in Costa Rica, she studied Spanish at a university while living with a family. She is honored to be a member of GeoKids, and her continued passion for teaching children, parents, and teachers can be seen at Little Aviators on a daily basis.<br><br>

<strong>Jessica Ballenger</strong><br>
Jessica has been working with children since 2003. Her first job was on the campus of Cal State Fullerton, where Jessica received her undergraduate degree in Psychology with a minor in Human Services. After college, she attended Alliant University and received her master's degree in Marriage and Family Therapy in May 2010. Working with children is one of her many passions - she also loves music and dancing. Jessica is so happy to be at GeoKids' Little Aviators and is proud to have had the experience of being here on opening day in April 2010. She hopes to bring some of her therapeutic skills to children to help them grow socially and emotionally.<br><br>

<strong>Kiersten Brown</strong><br>
As the daughter of a former elementary school teacher, Kiersten has always had the passion to help others and to work with children. Her first teaching experience was assisting her mother in her second grade classes. In 2006, Kiersten stepped outside of the classroom and started working in the daycare/preschool setting. Other experiences include teaching ballet, hip-hop, and tap to younger children, as well as babysitting and volunteering. Kiersten is currently pursuing a B.S. at Cal State Dominguez Hills. She expects to graduate in the spring of 2011 with a degree in Child Development.<br><br>

<strong>Shannon Cooper</strong><br>
Shannon has worked with children since she was 16, in both special and regular education. No matter the group of children, they always remind her to look at all things and situations in a new light. She has wanted to be an educator since she can remember and has been working diligently for the past four years to perfect her craft. Now that she is with GeoKids' Little Aviators, she plans to push herself in the Reggio method and to help the children evolve into caring, self-confident thinkers who can make the best decisions.<br><br>

<strong>Karolynh Tran</strong><br>
Karolynh has been learning about, observing, and working with young children since 2002. She's increased her knowledge of child development and family studies to family life education in order to receive a whole family approach. Having a passion for expanding kids' early development, she truly enjoys seeing life through the eyes and ears of children. Her other interests include baking, reading, traveling, listening to music, organizing, and eating (a lot!).<br><br>
