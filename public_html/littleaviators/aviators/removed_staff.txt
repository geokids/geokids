<strong>Micaela Brambila</strong><br>
Micaela is a graduate of Cal State Dominguez Hills, where she obtained her bachelor's degree in Liberal Studies. She has experience working in a California Distinguished School, Jefferson, in the city of Lennox since 2005. Micaela is very enthusiastic about life and growing up. She enjoys happy, smiling moments with her Little Aviators and sharing their growth with staff and parents. What she loves most about being a teacher and being around children are the funny things kids say, the silly things they do, and the questions they ask. She enjoys teaching and learning new techniques for developing minds. When not caring for her students, she is caring for her nieces and nephews at home and with relatives. To stay fresh and focused, Micaela loves to ride her bike up and down the coast and spend as much time as possible in the outdoors, connecting with the world, and attending school in the afternoons.<br><br>

<strong>Vivian York</strong><br>
Born in California, Vivian has a natural love of the outdoors. She likes to camp and hike in deserts and mountains, poke around tide pools, and scour the beach for shells. Since graduating from UCLA with degrees in dance and art, she has worked with children of all ages and in various educational arenas, teaching movement, art, book making, cooking, sewing, and academic classes as well. Having just finished her ECE units, she is happy to find herself working at GeoKids' Little Aviators with the children she learns the most from, kids age 2 to 5 - you can recognize them by the wonder all over their faces.<br><br>
