<h2>Waitlist</h2>
<p>Due to the high demand for quality childcare, GeoKids does have a waitlist.  As a precaution, we not only strongly recommend that you submit an application(s) as early as possible, but we also urge you to apply to more than one childcare center.  Applications are accepted during the mother-to-be's pregnancy, or any time thereafter.   
<p>The waitlist is updated in the late winter through a mailing of the Update Waitlist form. The Update Waitlist form must be returned to GeoKids to remain on the waitlist. No additional fee will be required.
