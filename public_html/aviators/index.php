<h2>GeoKids History</h2>
GeoKids is a non-profit organization incorporated for public benefit, with a chartered purpose to provide affordable quality childcare to the U.S. Geological Survey and the public. Our first priority is children, whom we want to be well cared for, stimulated, and encouraged to discover the world around them. GeoKids is sponsored by General Services Administration (GSA), and it currently provides high-quality childcare to the USGS and other local federal agencies in Northern California.<br><br> 

Toward the broader fulfillment of GeoKids chartered purpose, in the spring of 2010 the GeoKids Board of Directors approved operating a second GSA-sponsored childcare program. Little Aviators, is located at the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) site in Southern California. <br><br>


<h2>Little Aviators Childcare Center</h2>
Little Aviators was opened in 1997 and occupies approximately 3800 sf. ft. indoors of the Hawthorne Federal Building.  Little Aviators was designed as a mini-center model and has 2 open, mixed age classrooms.  An outdoor playground of approximately 10,000 sq. ft. is located adjacent to the center. All spaces meet the requirements for CA title 22 regulations for Child Care Centers, the accreditation standards set by the National Association of the Education of Young Children, and are accessible by people with differing abilities. Preschool children approximately 2 to 5.9 years of age attend our preschool programs. A maximum of 15 children are cared for at any one time in each classroom; two full time teachers and an aids will provide a 6:1 ratio.<br><br>

<h2>Curriculum</h2>
We draw our inspiration from a variety of sources including the schools of Reggio Emilia in northern Italy as well as Lillian Katz, George Forman, John Dewey and many others.  We find some of the principles of the education project in the Reggio Schools to be especially persuasive.  We base our work with children in the firm belief that children are competent and capable, constantly seeking opportunities to manifest their competence.   We see children and teachers as co-learners, partnering to enhance the learning process through reciprocal interactions and exploration.<br><br>

It is our belief that good curriculum is child-centric and play based.  It engages children in long-term projects where real investigations are pursued.  Children's interests often lead to in-depth explorations that can last a few days or many months.  Curriculum grows out of our understanding that young children learn best and thrive when their natural disposition toward curiosity is engaged and their investigations are hands-on. Children are most curious about the real world around them.  They are natural researchers.   As such, they respond to curriculum that emerges out of their own experiences and is enhanced by provocations and resources provided by the teachers, families, and the children themselves.  You may very well see seasonal natural materials such as pumpkins and gourds of all sizes and shapes appearing in the classroom for purposes of exploration, experimentation and even cooking.  Teachers become ardent researchers in partnership with the children.  The role of the teacher as facilitator, listener, partner, advocate, provocateur, historian, risk-taker is vital to the learning outcomes of the children. Perceptive teachers pick up on these interests and through keen observation, find ways to enhance and deepen the explorations that engage the children.  Perceptive teachers also know the value of a rich environment where words, books, music, art, and interactions abound, all resources at a child's fingertips. <br><br>
