<strong>GeoKids History</strong>
<br>
GeoKids was founded in 1987 by a group of parents who worked on the United States Geological Survey Campus (USGS) and the Stanford Research Institute (SRI). Over the past twenty years, GeoKids has grown into an exciting learning environment for children, families, and educators.<br>
<br>
<strong>Inspiration</strong>
<br>
The GeoKids community is inspired by the work of Jean Piaget, Lev Vygotsky, Lillian Katz, Vivien Paley, and Bev Boss. GeoKids is also greatly influenced by the educators of Reggio Emilia. The GeoKids staff has been studying this philosophy for the past 12 years and has committed to sending two teachers annually to Italy with the study groups organized by Reggio Children.<br>
<br>
<strong>Guiding Principles</strong>
<br>
GeoKids guiding principles are greatly influenced by the Reggio philosophy. Several key principles include:<br><br>

<strong>Children</strong>
<br>
All children have preparedness, potential, curiosity, and interest in constructing their learning, in engaging in social interaction and in negotiating with everything that their environment brings to them.<br>
<br>
<strong>Parents</strong>
<br>
Parenting is likely the most important vocation. GeoKids believes that confident parents trust in their abilities to know what is best for their children. We prefer that parents be judged not by their mistakes but by their successes. GeoKids parents partner with their children's caregivers to foster respectful and supportive relationships in their children's lives.<br>
<br>
<strong>Teachers</strong>
<br>
Providing care for children in a group setting is a challenging profession that requires significant training and dedication. At GeoKids, teachers have the space and time they need to be reflective about their own processes, the security to take risks in developing their curricula, and the flexibility to address all of a child's needs: emotionally, academically, and otherwise. Parents often benefit from the language, educational tools and various styles GeoKids' teachers employ. Our children develop close bonds with their teachers that ensure long after the day or the school year ends. Teachers have the full support of parents, staff and administration.<br>
<br>
<strong>Community</strong>
<br>
The children, parents and caregivers who make up the GeoKids community recognize their broader community of friends and neighbors and the potential for collaboration. GeoKids is an active participant in the community for education in the processes of parenting and childhood learning. We welcome opportunities to partner with members of our community to advance early childhood education.
